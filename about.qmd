### More about me: 

I completed my undergrad education on Biostatistics in UC SanDiego, where I devoted the bulk of my undergraduate extracurricular time to the development of analysis programs for neuro-fluorescence data.

Currently I am a 1st Year ScM Biostatistics students at JHSPH. I am interested in the modelling of infectious disease transmission. But I will happily engage other research directions that involves the development of novel computational methods.
