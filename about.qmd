#### **Hello, my name is Weishan Li**

I completed my undergrad education on Biostatistics in UC SanDiego. And I devoted the bulk of my undergraduate extracurricular time to the development of analysis programs for neuro-fluorescence data.

I am currently interested in the modelling of infectious disease transmission. But I will happily engage other research directions that involves the development of novel computational methods.
