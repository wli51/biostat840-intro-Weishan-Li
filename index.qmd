### Hello, 

#### This is a Quarto website I made for Statistical Programming Paradigms and Workflows Project 1.

I am Weishan Li. I came from Shanghai, China. After finishing high school there, I went to the U.S for college. In my spare times I play computer games.

Recently I am enjoying putting together this split keyboard kit which is ergonomic-wise better for typing.
